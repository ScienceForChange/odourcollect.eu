    "<p>The app can also be used to report bad odours in affected communities by odour nuisance with the aim of co-creating solutions with all the stakeholders involved (citizens, industries, local authorities, citizen scientists and odour experts) to improve the quality of life of a community. Frequent exposure to annoying odours can cause headache, stress, anxiety, lack of concentration, insomnia or even increase respiratory problems. Even though ambient odours are the second cause of environmental complaints after noise worldwide, in many places there is no specific regulation to control the problem, meaning that there is no legal framework to protect citizens! You can learn more about existing regulations in odour pollution in the D-NOSES Policy brief. And you can help us map affected communities and odour regulations worldwide in our Odour Observatory.</p>" +
    "<p>OdourCollect is a tool to empower communities affected by odour nuisance, reporting it to the world! The odour observations will be validated by citizen science and odour experts to gather data in a particular area where a community is suffering from the problem with the aim of co-designing local solutions with the relevant stakeholders.</p>" +
    "<p>Thanks for participating in this citizen science experiment, helping us to build up collaborative odour maps!</p>" +
    "<p>OdourCollect is inspired by a standardized European methodology to evaluate odour episodes through trained citizens' observations: the German standard VDI 3940:2006 (Measurement of odour impact by field inspection. Measurement of the impact frequency of recognizable odours - Grid measurement), which has become in the European standard CEN 16841. Although the standard defines a strict methodology to measure odours (odour observations are to be gathered during a certain time - typically one year - in a specific area and are performed by certified standard human “noses” or observers), OdourCollect adapts the methodology to gather real-time data on odour perception anywhere, anytime, by any citizen. Our methodology is under validation in 10 pilot projects all around the globe, and we aim to develop a new standard to be replicated worldwide.</p>" +
    "<p>OdourCollect is an idea from Science for Change. This app has been developed thanks to the D-NOSES project (Distributed Network for Odor Sensing, Empowerment and Sustainability). We are validating our bottom-up methodology in 10 pilot projects in 10 countries (Spain, Portugal, Greece, Bulgaria, Chile, Italy, UK, Germany, Austria and Uganda).</p><p>This project has received funding from the Research and Innovation program of the European Union Horizón 2020 under agreement No. 789315 as well as FECYT, the Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology - Ministry of Science and Innovation.</p><p style='text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;'><img style='max-width: 400px;' src='../../../img/general/fecyt.png'/> </p><p>This project is part of the Barcelona Citizen Science Office.</p>"

  METHODOLOGY: {
    TEXT: '<p>Through OdourCollect any citizen can act as the observer and collect geo-localised open data on an odour episode, both in space and time, which can be used to build collaborative odour maps. Yes, you too, since you have the best sensor to measure odours: your own nose! Yours’ and your neighbours’ observations will allow to demonstrate an odour problem in an affected community, empowering citizens to put the issue on the map. For the first time, real-time data on odour impact will be gathered from the receptor’s point of view thanks to your contributions, and will be correlated with the industrial processes. From the data analysis and validation, we will co-design local improvements together with the odour emitting industries, the local city councils and the contributing neighbours, to improve your quality of life.</p>' +
    "<p>Reporting an odour complaint with OdourCollect will take just a minute. After registering (just choose a name or nickname and validate your registration through the provided e-mail address), the app will automatically geo-locate you. Do not worry, the App only geolocalises you every time you want to put a new odour on the map and your name will be hidden under a user name with a number. You will just need to fill in the following information:</p>" +
    "<ul>" +
    "<li>What does it smell like? (if unknown, you can always guess!). Click on the question mark for more information about each type of odour. You can choose between the following categories: " +
    "<ul><li>Waste</li><li>Waste water</li><li>Agriculture/ livestock</li><li>Food industries</li><li>Urban odours</li><li>Nice smells!</li></ul>" +
    "</li>" +
    "<li>For each category, you can choose different types of odour. It looks difficult but we will be training the citizens in the affected communities! For example, for “waste”, there are many types of associated odours. Click on the question mark for more information about each sub-type of odour." +
    "<ul><li>Fresh waste</li><li>Decomposed waste</li><li>Leachate</li><li>Biogas</li><li>Biofilter</li><li>Ammonia</li><li>Amines</li><li>Other</li><li>I don’t know</li></ul>" +
    "</li>" +
    "<li>Odour intensity, on a scale from 1 to 6 (based on standard VDI 3882 Part 1: Determination of odour intensity): It is likely that you map odours with intensities of 3 or more (when you distinguish them clearly, or when they are bothering you). However, it is quite unlikely that you find a intensity of 6 in the streets of your neighbourhood. Intensity, though, is subjective, so please rate your perception based on the descriptions given in brackets." +
    "<ul>" +
    "<li>1: Very weak (it is difficult to perceive it)</li><li>2: Weak (almost everybody can notice an odour in the ambient air)</li>" +
    "<li>3: Distinct (an odour is clearly present in the air by everybody)</li><li>4: Strong (the odour starts to annoy)</li>" +
    "<li>5: Very strong (the odour is clearly annoying)</li><li>6: Extremely strong (the odour is almost unbearable)</li>" +
    "</ul></li>" +
    "<li>Is it nice or foul? , From -4 (if the odour is unpleasant) to 0 (neutral) and to 4 (if the odour is pleasant), based on standard VDI 3882 Part 2: Determination of hedonic odour tone.</li>" +
    "<li>Additional information:" +
    "<li>How long has the episode lasted? In case you are in the area for a while, please give us the following information:" +
    "<ul><li>Punctual odour (non continuous smell)</li><li>Continuous odour in the last hour</li><li>Continuous odour throughout the day</li></ul>" +
    "</li>" +
    "<li>Where does the odour come from (if known or suspected)? This is important information to technically discover the odour source where to act.</li>" +
    "</ul>" +
    "<p>Add comments if you want :)</p>" +
    "<p>Soon you will be able to add pictures as well!</p>" +
    "<p>If you are not interested in reporting an odour episode but are curious about the odours perceived in your area, just check the map and the odour reports filled up by other citizens. You will be able to check and to filter the map by type of odour You can also add any odour observation in any part of the world, not only in affected communities. Also nice smells! Feel free to navigate and to become and odour hound!</p>"

    "<p>You are willing to participate in D-NOSES, a citizen science project based on citizen interventions to tackle odour pollution using a bottom-up approach (starting from the citizens) and involving a quadruple helix stakeholders (local authorities, odour experts, industries and communities). Before taking part and after having understood the purpose of the project explained in the H and OEI information document, is essential to us that you understand which personal data are we collecting and how we will be treating this information. Please, read this information carefully. If you have any doubt or something is unclear to you, please ask any of the project partners - face-to-face when possible or by email at ethics@ibercivis.es.</p>" +
    "<h3>Purpose of the project</h3>" +
    "<p>D-NOSES aims to kick-start a much needed collaborative journey to tackle the problem of odours at a global scale by developing coordinated local case studies in 10 European and non-European countries (the D-NOSES pilots). Several project actions will guarantee a high impact and project sustainability. With the aim of situating odour pollution in the map, the International Odour Observatory (IOO) will be created to promote engagement and public participation. The results of the D-NOSES project will improve the management of odour problems, after the validation of the proposed innovative, bottom-up methodology to monitor, for the first time, the real perception of nuisance in the impact area of odour emitting activities. The analysis of the results of each pilot will be used to co-create DIY Guidelines for Project Replicability and standard criteria for future odour regulations at different levels, together with the Green Paper and the Strategic Roadmap for Governance in odour pollution, which will pave the way for capacity building and an improved regulatory framework in odour pollution.</p>" +
    "<h3>What will I have to do if I decide to take part?</h3>" +
    "<p>You can contribute through a workshop, interview, using the OdourCollect App, or submitting data to the Odour Observatory. In the case of OdourCollect App, you will collect odour observations related to the pilot that you are participating in. You will not use the application in an unethical way, that is, you will not upload fake data with bad faith (in any case, fake data will be identified during the data validation process and not uploaded in the public map). In order to use the OdourCollect App or the Odour Observatory some personal data is required. All personal data is regulated under the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GRPD). You can erase all your personal data from all the project platform at any time. You can also download all the data that you have provided to the project. Participation in thisproject is completely voluntary. You can also be part of audio/video recording or photographs which might be used only to document and disseminate the project activities.</p>" +
    "<h3>What will be the benefits or risks of taking part in D-NOSES?</h3>" +
    "<p>There are no economic incentives for your participation in the project. In D-NOSES, NGOs, CSOs, local public authorities, odour emitting industries and academia, together with citizens, will co-create ad-hoc local solutions to odour pollution to mitigate the associated nuisance and increase the overall quality of life. However, there is no direct connection between this research project and government action, or any actions to be potentially undertaken by odour emitting activities. Due to health and safety reasons, pregnant women cannot participate in olfactometry analysis and odour panels according to the European standard EN 13725:2003 Air quality. Determination of odour concentration by dynamic olfactometry. However, pregnant women are welcome to report odour observations using the OdourCollect App in their living area or in any other place where they would perceive an odour.</p>" +

    "<p>No, there is no direct connection between this research project and government action.</p>" +
    "<h3>How to withdraw from the project?</h3>" +
    "<p>You are free to leave the project at any moment. All personal data is regulated under the GRPD, so you can exercise your rights according to this law. The OdourCollect App and the Odour Observatory provide an interface to erase all your personal data, although by default, the observation data and other non-personal data you have uploaded to the platform will be maintained. However, you can request its complete elimination by email at ethics@ibercivis.es.</p>" +
    "<h3>What will the information be used for?</h3>" +
    "<p>We will not use personal data for the research, we will require only a minimal amount of personal data, such email or nickname, to authenticate/deauthenticate users in the Odour Collect App or the Odour Observatory, and some other data such a age, gender or place of residence for statistical purposes.</p>"
